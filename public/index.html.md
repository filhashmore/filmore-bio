## About the Artist

**FILMORE**, a native of Wildwood, Missouri, is making waves in the country music scene. As the first independent artist to be featured on Spotify's Hot Country cover, he has rapidly amassed over 481 million career streams. Recently signed to Pitbull's Mr. 305 Records, FILMORE continues to shatter barriers between Country and Pop.

Known for his catchy hooks and clever lyrics, FILMORE has captured the attention of major outlets such as The New York Times, Rolling Stone Country, NBC's "TODAY" show, The Bobby Bones Show, CMT, and Sirius XM's "The Highway."

His electric live performances have seen him opening for notable acts like Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood, Dan + Shay, Brett Young, Pitbull, and more. He has also delivered memorable performances at renowned festivals like Stagecoach, CMA Fest, Windy City Smokeout, and Country Thunders.

A first-generation American with Colombian heritage, FILMORE is gearing up to release his fourth studio album ATYPICAL — a 21-song powerhouse dropping February 20, 2026, via Mr. 305 Records, with a co-project alongside Pitbull coming later in 2026.
